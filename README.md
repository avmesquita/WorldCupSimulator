# WORLD CUP SIMULATOR

Ever since I was a kid, every football world cup has made tables with the result information data. Over time there were spreadsheets in excel format that we were going to fill in the results and today the search engines already give us the results before anything else.

Therefore, I decided to create a web project with an Angular frontend to display the information and possibly an api in nestjs in case the project grows in size.

I intend to evolve it over time, without rushing, if anyone is interested in joining this journey of data and calculations from the world of the world cups, I accept a partnership on this journey, even if it is to create issues of possibilities that this project can achieve.

For now I just know that I started a new side project and that it tends to display the basic information about the championship. I have plans to improve the interface and include interactivity with the data so that I can change results using localstorage for multiple users within reach of their own tablet, mobile phone or computer.
